Code creates a chat interface using Streamlit that retrieves context from uploaded documents and answers user queries based on the retrieved context. The code uses various libraries including pymupdf for PDF processing, langchain_text_splitters for text splitting, and faiss for vector similarity search. It establishes a conversation flow by prompting the model with system messages and human inputs.
